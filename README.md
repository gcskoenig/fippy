# A Python Library for Relative Feature Importance (RFI)

In this library we offer an implementation of Relative Feature Importance including:

- a variety of conditional sampling techniques
- visualization
- significance testing

The library is accompagnied by our ICPR paper [[arXiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08283)

## Sampling techniques

- Gaussian Sampling
- Conditional Normalizing Flows

## Installation

```
python setup.py install --user
```
